# TTC-Subway-Delay-Analysis-and-Reduction

This project analyzes Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway delay data to develop predictive and prescriptive analytics for delay reduction. The goal is to reduce average delays by 10%, improving rider experience and operational efficiency.

# Key Project Components:

Data Analysis: Utilized Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to analyze TTC subway delay data for the year 2023.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted comprehensive EDA to identify patterns and causes of delays across different stations, lines, and time periods.

Predictive Modeling: Implemented machine learning techniques, including Linear Regression, to forecast delays based on historical data.

Statistical Analysis: Applied statistical methods to evaluate the significance of various factors contributing to delays.

Visualization: Created insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent delay patterns and trends.

Recommendations: Developed data-driven recommendations for reducing delays and improving subway system efficiency.
